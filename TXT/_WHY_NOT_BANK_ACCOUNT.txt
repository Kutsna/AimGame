Thought for 26s
You’re not doing anything wrong—the “Add payment method (Bank transfer / Wire)” section is hidden until your AdMob/AdSense account hits Google’s payment-setup threshold (roughly €10 or $10 in finalized earnings). You’re at €0.54, so the page only shows “Payments account / profile / users” and no bank section yet.

What will happen automatically

As soon as your balance reaches the small verification threshold (~€10), the Payments page will show a banner “Your payments are on hold” and two tasks:

Verify address (PIN mailed to your address), and

Add payment method → Bank transfer / Wire (IBAN + SWIFT)

After you complete those, you’ll get paid once your balance reaches the payout threshold (€70 in your screenshots).

Quick checks (you already pass these):

Country: Georgia ✅

Account type: Individual ✅

Name & address: Verified ✅

U.S. tax info: W-8BEN submitted ✅

Role: you’re listed under Payments users (so you have access) ✅

So the missing “Bank transfer” button isn’t a bug or a wrong page—Google just hasn’t unlocked it yet. Keep serving ads; once you cross ~€10 (finalized), the button appears and you can add your IBAN/SWIFT right away.
