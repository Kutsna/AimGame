When app starts:
Check if the purchais of "remove_ads" are done and if true, assign "true" to "removeAds".
Check if the purchais of "remove_timer" is done and if true, assign "true" to "removeTimer".
Send "removeAds" and "removeTimer" to GameView.kt.
If "removeAds == true" show no bannerA and no bannerB and no intersterstitial ads on the device from which the purchaise is done.
If "removeTimer == true" show no Timer on the device from which the purchaise is done.
