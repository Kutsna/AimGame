  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p>Last updated: July 13, 2025</p>
  <p>This Privacy Policy describes how <strong>AimGame</strong> (“we”, “our” or “the App”) collects, uses, and discloses information when you use the AimGame mobile application (the “App”) on Android devices.

  <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
  <h3>1.1 Local Data</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Game Settings & Progress</strong><br>
      High scores, current level, sound on/off preferences and other gameplay settings are stored locally on your device in Android’s <code>SharedPreferences</code>. This data is <strong>never</strong> uploaded to our servers or shared with any third party.
    </li>
  </ul>

    <li>Basic ad-viewing events (e.g. which ads you saw, when you tapped an ad)</li>

  <p>All ad and analytics data collection is governed by Google’s own privacy policy. We do <strong>not</strong> receive or store your Advertising ID or IP address ourselves.</p>

  <h2>2. How We Use Information</h2>
